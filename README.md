## How to Use It

 I am assuming React Native is installed (https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html) in your machine.

- Download or Clone this project 
- Open cmd in Admin mode. You can do it by pressing Window button, type cmd then right click on cmd icon and choose run as Administrator
- Switch to your Project Directory by typing  "cd path_to_downloaded_Directory/React-Native-Sample" in command prompt.
- Type "react-native start" let it do it's job for few minutes.
- Start Android emulator or add your Android device through ADB.
- Now open another command prompt in Admin mode and run "react-native run-android" command inside the same folder to launch the app on   your Android emulator. You should be having 2 cmd prompt this time - first one is your server and this one is building the app.

If everything is set up correctly, you should see React Native Example app running in your Android emulator shortly.
